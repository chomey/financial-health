# Tasks

<!--
  Populate this file with discrete, well-defined tasks.
  Each task should be completable in a single Ralph Loop iteration.

  Format:
  - [ ] Task N: Short title — Longer description of what needs to be done

  Tips for good tasks:
  - Keep them small and atomic (one thing per task)
  - Order them so dependencies come first
  - Be specific about what "done" looks like
  - Include file paths or function names when relevant

- [ ] Task 3: Build app shell & navigation — Create the main layout, nav bar, and page routing with placeholder pages
- [ ] Task 4: Build core screen with mock data — Implement the primary UI screen using hardcoded/mock data so it's visually verifiable

- [ ] Task 6: Wire real data into UI — Replace mock data with real data layer, keeping the UI intact
- [ ] Task 7: Implement feature X — Build [specific feature] end-to-end (UI + logic)
