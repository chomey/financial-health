# Tasks

<!--
  Populate this file with discrete, well-defined tasks.
  Each task should be completable in a single Ralph Loop iteration.

  Format:
  - [ ] Task N: Short title — Longer description of what needs to be done

  Tips for good tasks:
  - Keep them small and atomic (one thing per task)
  - Order them so dependencies come first
  - Be specific about what "done" looks like
  - Include file paths or function names when relevant
