## Task 1: [ARCH] Initialize Next.js project with Tailwind CSS and Vitest
- **Status**: Complete
- **Date**: 2026-02-27
- **Changes**:
  - `package.json`: Created with Next.js 16.1.6, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, Vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, @vitejs/plugin-react, jsdom
  - `vitest.config.ts`: Created with jsdom environment, React plugin, @/ path alias, tests/unit/ include path
  - `tests/setup.ts`: Created with jest-dom/vitest matchers and cleanup after each test
  - `tests/unit/setup.test.tsx`: T1 unit test verifying page renders title, tagline, and welcome message
  - `src/app/globals.css`: Custom Tailwind color palette — warm greens (emerald), teal, warm neutrals (stone), soft blues, celebratory gold/amber, soft rose
  - `src/app/layout.tsx`: Updated metadata title and description for Financial Health Snapshot
  - `src/app/page.tsx`: Replaced default Next.js page with styled app shell using custom palette
  - `eslint.config.mjs`: Created flat ESLint config using eslint-config-next
  - `tsconfig.json`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `next.config.ts`, `.gitignore`: Scaffolded by create-next-app
- **Test tiers run**: T1
- **Tests**:
  - `tests/unit/setup.test.tsx`: Verifies home page renders title, tagline, and welcome message (3 passed, 0 failed)
- **Notes**: Used Next.js 16.1.6 (latest available via create-next-app). eslint-config-next v16 exports flat config natively — no FlatCompat needed. Tailwind v4 uses CSS-based `@theme inline` for custom colors instead of tailwind.config.js.

## Task 2: Set up Playwright screenshot & test infrastructure
- **Status**: Complete
- **Date**: 2026-02-27
- **Changes**:
  - `package.json`: Added @playwright/test dev dependency
  - `playwright.config.ts`: Created with chromium project, baseURL localhost:3000, webServer running `npm run dev`, tests in tests/e2e/
  - `tests/e2e/helpers.ts`: Screenshot helper utility — `captureScreenshot(page, name)` saves full-page PNG to screenshots/
  - `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`: Smoke test verifying homepage loads with title, tagline, and welcome message; captures screenshot
  - `tests/unit/screenshot-helpers.test.ts`: T1 unit tests for screenshot path construction logic
  - `.gitattributes`: Created to track *.png, *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.gif, *.webp, *.svg via Git LFS
  - `screenshots/`: Created directory for automated screenshots
- **Test tiers run**: T1, T2, T3
- **Tests**:
  - `tests/unit/screenshot-helpers.test.ts`: Verifies screenshot path construction, absolute paths, and name handling (3 passed, 0 failed)
  - `tests/unit/setup.test.tsx`: Pre-existing tests still passing (3 passed, 0 failed)
  - `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`: Homepage loads with title, tagline, welcome message; screenshot captured (1 passed, 0 failed)
  - Total: 7 passed, 0 failed
- **Screenshots**:
  ![Homepage loaded](screenshots/task-2-home-loaded.png)
- **Notes**: Installed only chromium browser to keep setup lightweight. Playwright webServer config auto-starts `npm run dev` for E2E tests. Screenshot helper is simple and reusable for future tasks.
